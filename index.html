        <p>Born in Costa Rica. I am made out of cells.
            <br>I inhabit in a planet called Earth where I consume oxygen and give nothing in return for the planet other than CO2 that fuels desforestation.
            <br>This is the best website you'll ever find in the web because I say so.
            <br>Is that angel looking girl in the picture me? Yepp.
            <br>My major is graphic design and my job is to design for sloths because they are critically endagered.
            <br>Also llamas and alpacas are important.
            <br>I believe chickens are amazing and they should conquer the world.
            <br>Let's go llamas!
